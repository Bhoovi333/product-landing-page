So, hi everyone This is the first project I made by using REACT .
I started learning react through projects, This is the first one, not as fancy as product landing pages are,but covering initials of react,so that my understandability towards this library expands in a fruitful manner.Hope you all like it.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
